## ABOUT
An application that used Axios and Cheerio to scrape off another website, store it into a MongoDB Database and display it on the on the page. Mongoose is used to create the collections for this project and allow the user to save thier favorite articles, as well as 
add comments to the articles. Using Handlebars to grab the data and display it, the user can click on the "link" button and 
be brought to the scraped website that gives more information about the title. The user can also delete all saved articles as well as every article on the home page. If they click the "Scrape" button it will scrape from https://www.supercrosslive.com/news/ again and return a new set of articles!
